2 Simple Slider: Easily navigate through content using an intuitive and user-friendly slider, enhancing the overall usability of the app.

3 To-Do List: Stay organized and productive with a handy to-do list feature that helps you manage your tasks efficiently.

4 Weather Information: Stay informed about the weather in any city you desire, complete with a dynamically changing background to reflect day and night conditions.

5 Subtle Effects like Parallax: Experience delightful user interactions with subtle effects like the parallax effect, adding a touch of elegance to the application.
